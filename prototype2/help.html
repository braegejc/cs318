                <p>
                    It’s myth that food allergies aren’t that serious. And that eating a little bit won’t hurt. And that each allergic reaction
                    will get worse and worse. Food allergies are more than an itch or stomachache. Hives, difficulty breathing,
                    vomiting, and/or loss of consciousness are all common symptoms. If an allergic reaction becomes anaphylactic
                    it can be life threatening. People who encounter food allergies are always on high-alert to ensure that
                    they avoid reactions. Avoiding cross-contact between food allergens and safe food is just as avoiding
                    the allergen itself. Accidents do happen; however, as a community, we have to help ensure that food allergies
                    are always be taken seriously.

                <p>
                    This quote from the
                    <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/10/magazine/can-a-radical-new-treatment-save-children-with-severe-allergies.html">
                        NY Times</a> describes how the human body handles allergic reactions. It is imperative that we are
                    both knowledgeable of the symptoms and provide the proper support and care from those who are impacted
                    by food allergies.<br>
                </p>
                <blockquote>“In an allergic reaction, an ordinary food protein like peanut is misidentified as an invader, like a virus
                    or bacterium, to which the body needs to mount a defense. In the body of a person with a peanut allergy,
                    for example, the presence of peanut protein causes the release of peanut-specific IgE antibodies, which
                    sets off the release of a flood of chemicals, including histamines, into the bloodstream. Those chemicals
                    lead to the release of still more chemicals, and the chemical cascade escalates in a self-sustaining
                    feedback loop until the response causes the heart or the lungs to fail, and the person collapses — a
                    victim of friendly fire in a battle with an imaginary enemy. An EpiPen will prevent death if it’s used
                    within 20 minutes of exposure, but after that window, the reaction cannot always be halted.”
                    <br>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    If you or you know someone who appears to be having an anaphylactic episode, administer an Epi-pen. You will not hurt him/her.
                    But failing to act could cost a life. The video below provides instructions for the Epi-Pen. Administering
                    an Epi-pen is easy, so please give the video a click!
