                        It’s myth that food allergies aren’t that serious. And that eating a little bit won’t hurt. And that each allergic reaction
                        will get worse and worse. Food allergies are more than an itch or stomachache. Hives, difficulty
                        breathing, vomiting, and/or loss of consciousness are all common symptoms. If an allergic reaction
                        becomes anaphylactic it can be life threatening. People who encounter food allergies are always on
                        high-alert to ensure that they avoid reactions. Avoiding cross-contact between food allergens and
                        safe food is just as avoiding the allergen itself. Accidents do happen; however, as a community,
                        we have to help ensure that food allergies are always be taken seriously.

                        This quote from the
                        <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/10/magazine/can-a-radical-new-treatment-save-children-with-severe-allergies.html"
                            target="_blank">
                            NY Times</a> describes how the human body handles allergic reactions. It is imperative that we
                        are both knowledgeable of the symptoms and provide the proper support and care from those who are
                        impacted by food allergies.

                    <blockquote>“In an allergic reaction, an ordinary food protein like peanut is misidentified as an invader, like a
                        virus or bacterium, to which the body needs to mount a defense. In the body of a person with a peanut
                        allergy, for example, the presence of peanut protein causes the release of peanut-specific IgE antibodies,
                        which sets off the release of a flood of chemicals, including histamines, into the bloodstream. Those
                        chemicals lead to the release of still more chemicals, and the chemical cascade escalates in a self-sustaining
                        feedback loop until the response causes the heart or the lungs to fail, and the person collapses
                        — a victim of friendly fire in a battle with an imaginary enemy. An EpiPen will prevent death if
                        it’s used within 20 minutes of exposure, but after that window, the reaction cannot always be halted.”

                        If you or you know someone who appears to be having an anaphylactic episode, administer an Epi-pen. You will not hurt him/her.
                        But failing to act could cost a life. The video below provides instructions for the Epi-Pen. Administering
                        an Epi-pen is easy, so please give the video a click!
