                <h1 class="heading">About the Blog</h1>
                While Iâ€™m new to this blogging thing, I am a seasoned veteran when it comes to navigating a world full of allergens. While
                the "allergy free" journey seems especially difficult at times, it does get better! In fact, there is a large
                community of individuals, families, and peers (15 million in fact!) who are going through similar situations.
                With this blog, I am hoping to become a resource, a helping hand, and a watchful eye for the millions of
                people struggling to live a safe, stress free, and allergy free life. My goals for the blog are simple.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Educate</strong> my peers through allergy related articles</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Connect</strong> with the 15 million Americans who are challenged every day by food allergies</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Empower</strong> individuals to take back control of their life by providing resources/knowledge
                        on topics specific to navigating the world while managing food allergies.</li>
                </ul>
                I believe God gives each of us gifts and talents to serve those around us and make this world a better place. In return,
                God gave us a wonderful place to live - full of sunshine, fresh air, and of course . . . allergens! Some
                of the gifts I have been blessed with include cooking, coaching, and being empathetic of others going through
                tough times. I hope you will find inspiration through my blog to discover your own gifts and talents, and
                use them to help make this world a better place.
