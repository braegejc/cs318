        <p>
                Pikachu encountered Mew one day while playing with his friends Piplup,
                 Charmander, and Chikorita. Mew led them to a mysterious hole which
                  transported them all to the PokéPark. The fall knocked Pikachu 
                  unconscious, and he had a dream about Mew.

            <div class="name">Ampharos</div>
            <p>
                    Ampharos, as the chief of the Expedition Society, is primarily involved in investigating
                     the recent events of Pokémon being turned into stone by an unknown 
                     power. For this reason, Ampharos visits Serene Village, but due to 
                     his poor sense of direction, he gets lost in the plaza, dropping his 
                     Connection Orb in the process.

            <img src="https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/c/c1/Charizard_SSB4.png" alt="pokemon3">
            <div class="name">Charizard</div>
            <p>
                    Charizard is playable as a member of Pokémon Trainer's party, along with 
                    Squirtle and Ivysaur; the three Pokémon act as one "fighter" that is unlocked 
                    from the start. Compared to its teammates, Charizard is heavier, but boasts a 
                    range of hard-hitting moves, such as Rock Smash, and long range moves, such 
                    as Flamethrower.

            <div class="name">Mewtwo</div>
            <p>
                    Mewtwo has an unusual combination of attributes. Unlike other characters, its throws are 
                    exceedingly powerful, capable of KO'ing at similar percentages as smash attacks. 
                    t also boasts several fast attacks that can be linked together for simple and effective 
                    combos, and possesses an exceptional recovery.

            <div class="name">Jigglypuff</div>
            <p>
                    Jigglypuff appears again in the sequel, Super Smash Bros. Melee, but like the 
                    first game, it must be unlocked first by completing Classic Mode with any character. 
                    It shares the Pokémon Stadium with Pikachu, Mewtwo and Pichu. Jigglypuff's Pound 
                    attack is moved to its Side-B attack, and instead, Rollout is Jigglypuff's new B attack.

            <div class="name">Bidoof</div>
            <p>
                    Bidoof lived with his mother, who is a Bibarel, and his two Bidoof siblings in a dam 
                    before going to train at Wigglytuff's Guild. He aspired to be the best explorer ever,
                     so he left his hometown to be an apprentice at the guild. Bidoof was the newest member
                      of the guild before the player and their partner came to train, and was always making 
                      some sort of mistake. He is only trusted with basic chores and errands because of
                       his incompetence.
