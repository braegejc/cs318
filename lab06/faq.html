        <p class="answer">
            If you are traveling abroad, you might not be able to verify your WhatsApp account.
            The verification code is used to verify that you own the phone number. You must be able to verify your phone number via SMS or voice call. We cannot send the code via email.

        <h3>How to get a business account verified or confirmed</h3>
        <p class="answer">
            A business can't request or pay to have an account verified or confirmed.
            At this time, only some business accounts are verified on WhatsApp. Business verification is based on a variety of factors, such as whether the brand is notable.
            Business accounts may be confirmed if their WhatsApp phone number matches the phone number for their business.
