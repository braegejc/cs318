                <h1 class="heading">About Me</h1>

                Hello, my name is Katie Lippe and this is my attempt to give you a little glimpse of my life currently and sneak peak into
                the complicated world of allergens. To start, I grew up in the bustling town(!?) of Fredonia Wisconsin -
                population 2,160. I graduated from UW-Eau Claire in 2016 with a degree in psychology and I'm currently attending
                graduate school at UW-Stout. In my free time, I enjoy running in marathons (not training) and coaching youth
                figure skating in Eau Claire Wisconsin, a sport I grew up competing in my whole life.
                <br>
                <br> Unfortunately, I've struggled with stomach issues for most of my life and they have become increasingly
                worse over the past few years. Most of my doctor appointements and ER visits left me incredibly frustrated
                and confused because it felt like no one was willing to take the time and effort to diagnose the internal
                issues I was dealing with.
                <br>
                <br> I finally found a doctor that took time to listen to my symptoms and commit to helping me find an answer.
                After undergone countless blood tests and a variety of others, I finally was given an answer. The official
                diagnoses confirm that I have Eosinophilic Esophagitis and Eosinophilic Colitis (complicated terms saying
                that I have a build up of allergy cells in my esophagus). Despite the uneasiness of knowing you have two
                diseases, it was a great relief to finaly have something to move forward with. After being tested for food
                and environmental allergies, I learned that I was allergic to the following foods: Gluten, Almonds, Hazelnuts,
                Peanuts, Pistachios, Walnuts, Dairy, Eggs, Coconut, and Corn.
                <br>
                <br>Oddly enough, trying to explain my allergies and diseases to people brings me an unusual amount of anxiety;
                however, I've slowly learned that it simply has become the "new normal" and is not worth being embarassed
                about. Allergies also come with its fair share of challenges which is why I wanted to create this blog. Struggling
                with these constant challenges can be extremely difficult, so I hope that my blog can provide you bits of information that 
                eases the daily challenges.

                <h1 class="heading">About the Blog</h1>
                While Iâ€™m new to this blogging thing, I am a seasoned veteran when it comes to navigating a world full of allergens. While
                the "allergy free" journey seems especially difficult at times, it does get better! In fact, there is a large
                community of individuals, families, and peers (15 million in fact!) who are going through similar situations.
                With this blog, I am hoping to become a resource, a helping hand, and a watchful eye for the millions of
                people struggling to live a safe, stress free, and allergy free life. My goals for the blog are simple.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Educate</strong> my peers through allergy related articles</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Connect</strong> with the 15 million Americans who are challenged every day by food allergies</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Empower</strong> individuals to take back control of their life by providing resources/knowledge
                        on topics specific to navigating the world while managing food allergies.</li>
                </ul>
                I believe God gives each of us gifts and talents to serve those around us and make this world a better place. In return,
                God gave us a wonderful place to live - full of sunshine, fresh air, and of course . . . allergens! Some
                of the gifts I have been blessed with include cooking, coaching, and being empathetic of others going through
                tough times. I hope you will find inspiration through my blog to discover your own gifts and talents, and
                use them to help make this world a better place.
